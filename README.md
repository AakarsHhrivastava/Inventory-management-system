An inventory management system is the combination of technology (hardware and software) and processes and procedures that oversee the monitoring and maintenance of stocked products, whether those products are company assets, raw materials and supplies, or finished products ready to be sent to vendors or end consumers. This system can widely be used by normal shops, departmental stores or MNCs for keeping a proper track of the stock. It also consists of information like manager details, customer details etc. With the help of this system we can fix a minimum quantity of any inventory below which we need to place an order for that inventory. This will help us in good sales results and never the out of stock stage for any inventory.
